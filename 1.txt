3.00pm, till now we have built:
1. Login/Signup page
2. Block structure decided(backend)

In next 8hours, we aim at:
1. Google maps to locate user 
2. Encryption and mapping of hashids
3. Wallet structure

10am, at this point we have done with main objectives as follows:
1. Successful login/signup
2. Blockchain techonology built. Here, each node represents either a buyer or seller of electric power, and all of them are connected.
3. Hardware part: Since now, electric transmission takes place through wires. But there is an alternative to this, that we can transfer      electricity wirelessly. Solutions:
  (i)   Unmanned aerier vehicles
  (ii)  Resonant power transfer sytem that can be carried and operated
  (iii) Designing of power receiving board that uses sensors
4. Marketting plan: 5-10% of each block traded will be profit. 
  
At 12noon, we have reached almost end of our hackathon prpject "Block-Urja". Following are the features:
1.  Successful login/signup
2.  Blockchain techonology built. Here, each node represents either a buyer or seller of electric power, and all of them are connected.
3.  Hardware part: Since now, electric transmission takes place through wires. But there is an alternative to this, that we can transfer       electricity wirelessly. Solutions:
    (i) Power transmission via satellites, last year Japan conducted a research and tranmsitted electric power of around 2kilo watts at a         distance of 60meters.  
    (ii) Designing of power receiving board that uses sensors
    (iii) Resonant power transfer sytem that can be carried and operated
4. Marketting plan: 5-10% of each block traded will be profit. 
5. Advantages:
   (i)   Very fast in action
   (ii)  Cost effective for both buyer and seller
   (iii) Less fraudlents involvemnt
